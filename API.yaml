        The following fields shall be included in the JWT claim for access tokens issued by this authority:
        * `iss`, with the URL at which the token generation request was received.
        * `exp`, with a time no further than 1 hour in the future.

            is necessary to bound performance requirements for DSS instances and would
            likely be hit by, e.g., a large remote ID display provider that created
            a Subscription for each of their display client users' views.
