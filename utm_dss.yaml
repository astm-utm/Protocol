        Authorization from, or on behalf of, an authorization authority.  This authority shall issue access tokens that are JSON Web Tokens as defined in RFC 7519, using the `RS256` algorithm for the signature, publish to all providers the public key for verifying that signature, and implement standard OAuth server discovery mechanisms as described in RFC 8414.

        The following fields shall be included in the JWT claim for access tokens issued by this authority:
            * `iss`, with the URL at which the token generation request was received.
            * `exp`, with a time no further than 1 hour in the future.
            * `sub`, with unique ID of the client requesting the access token.
            * `scope`, with an array of strings indicating the scopes granted.
            * `jti`, according to RFC 7519.

        Only one scope shall be granted for a token.  The tokens granted by this authority shall protect against reuse of received tokens to impersonate the sender to other recipients (via use of the `aud` claim or other means).

        Clients shall provide these access tokens in an `Authorization` header in the form `Bearer <token>` in accordance with RFC 6750.

            exterior ring bounds the surface, and the interior rings (if

        State of an Operation.

        'Accepted': This Operation was fully deconflicted from other Entities at the time it changed to this state, but no aircraft associated with it are active yet.  The create or update request for this Operation must include a Key containing all OVNs for all relevant Entities.

        'Activated': One or more aircraft associated with this Operation are, or will imminently be, in flight.  The create or update request for this Operation must include a Key containing all OVNs for all relevant Entities.

        'NonConforming': This Operation is outside of the planned volume.  The new or updated volumes MUST contain the actual position of the aircraft.  In this state, the `/v1/operations/{entityid}/telemetry' USS-USS endpoint should response, if possible, to queries from USS peers.  The create or update request for this Operation may omit a Key in this case because the Operation is being adjusted as flown and cannot necessarily deconflict.

        'Contingent': This Operation is executing a contingency action, either because is has been NonConforming for a certain period of time, or because of operator initiation.  This state must transition to Ended.  The new or updated volumes MUST contain the actual position of the aircraft.  In this state, the `/v1/operations/{entityid}/telemetry' USS-USS endpoint should response, if possible, to queries from USS peers.  The create or update request for this Operation may omit a Key in this case because the Operation is being adjusted as flown and cannot necessarily deconflict.

        'Ended': This Operation has ended (due to either an Operator-induced change or flight completion).

            may query GET /subscriptions to see which Subscriptions are counting against
            their limit.  This problem should not generally be encountered because
            the Subscription limit should be above what any consumer that reasonably
            aggregates their Subscriptions should request.  But, a Subscription limit
            is necessary to bound performance requirements for DSS instances and would
            likely be hit by, e.g., a large remote ID display provider that created
            a Subscription for each of their display client users' views.
