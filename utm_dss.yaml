        Authorization from, or on behalf of, an authorization authority.  This authority shall issue access tokens that are JSON Web Tokens as defined in RFC 7519, using the `RS256` algorithm for the signature, and publish to all providers the public key for verifying that signature.

        The following fields shall be included in the JWT claim for access tokens issued by this authority:
            * `iss`, with the URL at which the token generation request was received.
            * `exp`, with a time no further than 1 hour in the future.
            * `sub`, with unique ID of the client requesting the access token.
            * `scope`, with an array of strings indicating the scopes granted.

        Multiple scopes for a single token shall be granted if requested.  The tokens granted by this authority shall protect against reuse of received tokens to impersonate the sender to other recipients (via use of the `aud` claim or other means).

        Clients shall provide these access tokens in an `Authorization` header in the form `Bearer <token>` in accordance with RFC 6750.

In this state, the {query-operation-details}/{id}/telemetry' endpoint MUST respond (if possible) to queries from USS peers.

        Create or update a subscription.  This call will fail if a Subscription with the same ID already exists.

        Subscription notifications are only triggered by (and contain full information of) changes to, creation of, or deletion of, Entities referenced by or stored in the DSS; they do not involve any data transfer (such as remote ID telemetry updates) apart from Entity information.

          description: Client already has too many Subscriptions in the area where
            a new Subscription was requested.  To correct this problem, the client
            may query GET /subscriptions to see which Subscriptions are counting against
            their limit.  This problem should not generally be encountered because
            the Subscription limit should be above what any consumer that reasonably
            aggregates their Subscriptions should request.  But, a Subscription limit
            is necessary to bound performance requirements for DSS instances and would
            likely be hit by, e.g., a large remote ID display provider that created
            a Subscription for each of their display client users' views.
