  description: |-
    Interface definitions for 'Discovery and Synchronization Service' (DSS) and 'UAS Service Supplier (USS).

    DSS functionality includes identification of peer UTM USS instances (managing flight operations and constraints).
    USS functionality includes sharing details of flight operations and constraints.

    Note: Unless otherwise specified, fields specified in a message but not declared in the API shall be ignored.

        Authorization from, or on behalf of, an authorization authority.  This authority shall issue access tokens that are JSON Web Tokens as defined in RFC 7519, using the `RS256` algorithm for the signature, publish to all providers the public key for verifying that signature, and implement standard OAuth server discovery mechanisms as described in RFC 8414.

        The following fields shall be included in the JWT claim for access tokens issued by this authority:
            * `iss`, with the URL at which the token generation request was received.
            * `exp`, with a time no further than 1 hour in the future.
            * `sub`, with unique ID of the client requesting the access token.
            * `scope`, with an array of strings indicating the scopes granted.
            * `jti`, according to RFC 7519.

        Only one scope shall be granted for a token.  The tokens granted by this authority shall protect against reuse of received tokens to impersonate the sender to other recipients (via use of the `aud` claim or other means).

        Clients shall provide these access tokens in an `Authorization` header in the form `Bearer <token>` in accordance with RFC 6750.

        the client whenever that client transmits the full information of the Entity

The contents of this data structure are generated by the client.

            exterior ring bounds the surface, and the interior rings (if

        Operation must include a Key containing all OVNs for all relevant Entities.

        'Activated': One or more aircraft associated with this Operation are, or will imminently be, in
        flight.  The create or update request for this Operation must include a Key containing all OVNs for
        all relevant Entities.

        'NonConforming': This Operation is outside of the planned volume.  The new or updated volumes MUST
        contain the actual position of the aircraft.  In this state, the `/v1/operations/{entityid}/telemetry'
        USS-USS endpoint should respond, if possible, to queries from USS peers.  The create or update request
        for this Operation may omit a Key in this case because the Operation is being adjusted as flown and
        cannot necessarily deconflict.

        'Contingent': This Operation is executing a contingency action, either because it has been
        NonConforming for a certain period of time, or because of operator initiation.  This state must
        transition to Ended.  The new or updated volumes MUST contain the actual position of the aircraft.
        In this state, the `/v1/operations/{entityid}/telemetry' USS-USS endpoint should respond, if possible,
        to queries from USS peers.  The create or update request for this Operation may omit a Key in this
        case because the Operation is being adjusted as flown and cannot necessarily deconflict.
