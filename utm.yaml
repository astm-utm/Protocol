  description: |-
    Interface definitions for 'Discovery and Synchronization Service' (DSS) and 'UAS Service Supplier (USS).

    DSS functionality includes identification of peer UTM USS instances (managing flight operations and constraints).
    USS functionality includes sharing details of flight operations and constraints.

    Note: Unless otherwise specified, fields specified in a message but not declared in the API shall be ignored.

        Authorization from, or on behalf of, an authorization authority.  This authority shall issue access tokens that are JSON Web Tokens as defined in RFC 7519, using the `RS256` algorithm for the signature, publish to all providers the public key for verifying that signature, and implement standard OAuth server discovery mechanisms as described in RFC 8414.

        The following fields shall be included in the JWT claim for access tokens issued by this authority:
            * `iss`, with the URL at which the token generation request was received.
            * `exp`, with a time no further than 1 hour in the future.
            * `sub`, with unique ID of the client requesting the access token.
            * `scope`, with an array of strings indicating the scopes granted.
            * `jti`, according to RFC 7519.

        Only one scope shall be granted for a token.  The tokens granted by this authority shall protect against reuse of received tokens to impersonate the sender to other recipients (via use of the `aud` claim or other means).

        Clients shall provide these access tokens in an `Authorization` header in the form `Bearer <token>` in accordance with RFC 6750.

        cannot necessarily deconflict.

        'Contingent': This Operation is executing a contingency action, either because it has been
        NonConforming for a certain period of time, or because of operator initiation.  This state must
        transition to Ended.  The new or updated volumes MUST contain the actual position of the aircraft.
        In this state, the `/v1/operations/{entityuuid}/telemetry' USS-USS endpoint should respond, if available,

        case because the Operation is being adjusted as flown and cannot necessarily deconflict.

            the Subscription limit should be above what any consumer that reasonably
            aggregates their Subscriptions should request.  But, a Subscription limit
            is necessary to bound performance requirements for DSS instances and would
            likely be hit by, e.g., a large remote ID display provider that created
            a Subscription for each of their display client users' views.

            Alternately, the client may have issued too many requests within a small
            period of time.
